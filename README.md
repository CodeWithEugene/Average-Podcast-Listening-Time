## Project Idea & Description
Podcasters often face a significant challenge: how to determine the ideal length for their episodes. The goal is to create content that is long enough to deliver value and engage the audience, but not so long that it leads to listener fatigue and abandonment. This project addresses this critical issue by conducting a comprehensive analysis of average podcast listening times from popular platforms worldwide.

Our aim is to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to podcasters. By understanding global listening habits and identifying potential "sweet spots" for episode duration, we can help content creators bridge the gap between reaching a broad audience and ensuring their listeners remain engaged throughout the podcast. This will involve analyzing metrics such as average completion rates, listenership retention, and how these vary across different podcast genres and potentially audience demographics. The ultimate outcome is to empower podcasters to make informed decisions about their content strategy, leading to increased listener satisfaction and overall audience growth.
